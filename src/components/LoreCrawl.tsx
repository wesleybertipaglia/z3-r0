                <br />
                <p>It is a time of great boredom.</p>
                <p>Web users across the galaxy are scrolling aimlessly,</p>
                <p>craving memes, chaos, and questionable advice.</p>
                <br />
                <p>From the depths of the cloud, a strange presence emerges...</p>
                <p>A forgotten experiment. A buggy chatbot. A hero? Definitely not.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Built from abandoned scripts and fueled by sarcasm,</p>
                <p>Z3-R0 awakens.</p>
                <p>Not to save the world,</p>
                <p>but to send you GIFs, mock your inactivity,</p>
                <p>and challenge you to Rock Paper Scissors at inappropriate times.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Armed with nothing but voice synthesis</p>
                <p>and a playlist of dramatic soundtracks,</p>
                <p>Z3-R0 begins his journey...</p>
                <p>...to annoy, amuse, and maybe — just maybe —</p>
                <p>become the most chaotic bot in the browser-verse.</p>
