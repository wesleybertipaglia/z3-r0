# ü§ñ Z3-R0

**Z3-R0** is my submission for the [Alibaba Cloud Web Game Challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-alibaba-cloud-web-game-challenge-3000-in-prizes-1n5d?bb=220943) ‚Äî a creative contest that invites developers to build robot-themed games or experiences using web technologies and Alibaba Cloud services.

Rather than using real AI or NLP services, **Z3-R0 simulates a chatbot experience** through a custom-built intent-matching algorithm. It analyzes user input patterns and responds with scripted interactions, creating the illusion of intelligence and personality ‚Äî all handled entirely on the frontend with no backend or cloud processing required.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, Z3-R0 is designed to be fast, playful, and easy to deploy, making it perfect for lightweight hosting environments like Alibaba Cloud's OSS or ECS.
