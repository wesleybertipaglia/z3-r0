# ü§ñ Z3-R0

This repository contains my submission for the [Alibaba Cloud Game Challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-alibaba-cloud-web-game-challenge-3000-in-prizes-1n5d?bb=220943), where participants were asked to build a creative game or interactive experience with a **robot-themed concept**.

**Z3-R0** is a sassy AI chatbot that plays games, cracks jokes, speaks out loud, and even entertains you when you're inactive. Built for fun and engagement, Z3-R0 is powered by web tech, AI vibes, and a dash of personality.
