# ü§ñ Z3-R0

**Z3-R0** is my submission for the [Alibaba Cloud Web Game Challenge](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-alibaba-cloud-web-game-challenge-3000-in-prizes-1n5d?bb=220943) ‚Äî a creative contest that invites developers to build robot-themed games or experiences using web technologies and Alibaba Cloud services.

![Z3-R0](./demo/z3r0.jpg)

Instead of a traditional game, I created an **interactive AI chatbot with a bold personality**, packed with entertainment features and lightweight design choices. Z3-R0 is your virtual sidekick: it chats, jokes, plays minigames, speaks aloud, and even reacts when you go AFK.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, Z3-R0 was designed to be fast, fun, and easily deployable ‚Äî even in resource-limited environments.
